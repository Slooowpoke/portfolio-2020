TudorQuest is a game created over the course of one month (but mostly in the last 24 hours). It was created by three people and we were pushed for time just because of other commitments.

Originally it was made for the 'One Game a Month Jam'. The game has 5 levels and was created by myself, Wing Lee and Sarah Hargreaves. 

(Editor note: I think the game might still work on Linux, but I don't think it works on Mac unless you have a really old runtime.)

Sol is a game made for Ludum Dare 30, made in 48 hours for the Connected Worlds theme. The game is made in Java with Slick2D and is probably the prettiest game I've ever made. It utlises Slick2D to simplify the calls to OpenGL made with LWJGL. 

How to play:

* You need one fuel to move one population.
* You need two population on a planet to colonise it
* Colonise all the planets by strategiically moving your population.

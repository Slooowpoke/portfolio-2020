SteveBook was a project created for April Fools Day 2014, its a simple little chat room made in Node.js. The chatroom has a variety of word filters and everyone was named Stephen. It's kindof a one time thing, but I made in the night before. 

I did used to host this still but instead I figured the source code would be enough. 

You can download the source code here.

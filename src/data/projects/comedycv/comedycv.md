ComedyCV was created during my third year of University for my user experience module.In this module we studied user interaction and design and were tasked with evaluating an existing design, creating usability tests and early prototypes of what a new design might hold. 

The prototype created achieved a first.The prototype created achieved a first, and uses Skeleton as a CSS framework. Some small CSS3 animations are used with the help of Animate.css, I took the project a step further and used PHP to parse the exisiting website, retrieving the comedians and the information about them. With the extra information I was able to create a working prototype with a live search bar.

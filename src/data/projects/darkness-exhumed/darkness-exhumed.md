Darkness Exhumed was a 2D sandbox survival game, inspired by Minecraft. 
The game was in work for a very long time and I learned how to program in Java along the way. 

The game is currently cancelled, but that isn't to say I won't pick it up later. 

Sadly, I can't find any online links for the game, so I need to re-upload it all. 
It's worth doing so I'll get around to it eventually.

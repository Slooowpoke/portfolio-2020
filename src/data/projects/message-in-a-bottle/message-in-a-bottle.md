Before University I created Message in the bottle, a semi-successful project which later lead to drawing and the InTheBottle. 

InTheBottle is a merged version of Message in a bottle and Drawing in a bottle. 

No messages are filtered and are all user submitted, so beware! 

The original site is now gone, but the upgraded version exists here:

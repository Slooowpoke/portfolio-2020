Take The Power Back (TTPB) is my newest creation, it took a really long time as I changed out the backend twice.

It's a website for reviewing your landlord. It's built with React and Server Side Rendering. The database is all in
DynamoDB and it uses one or two Lambda's written in Node. The core of the application is written in Javascript
using Node.JS and Koa.JS.

Go ahead and leave a review. I need to fully release it, but everything should work.

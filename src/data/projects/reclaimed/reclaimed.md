Reclaimed: Capture the log, is a game made from re-used assets from an older game. The game is very broken now due to some updater and launcher issues, but never really took off because of a lack of dedicated servers. Due to the launcher issues I had to remove the downloads, however it is quite likely that I'll return to it at some point.

The game utilised Slick2D and uses Kryonet for serialising classes before sending them over the network. Kryonet greatly simplified the networking process, though some more lag-compensation systems could have been added.

The game had a ton of people who contributed to it and I thank them for the efforts immensely.

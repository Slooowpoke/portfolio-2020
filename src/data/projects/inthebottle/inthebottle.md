InTheBottle is one of my most successful projects to date.

The website allows strangers to leave drawings and messages for others, and most recently allows users to draw together in realtime.

It has amassed over 3,000,000 page requests and has around 5,000ish users, though the number of active is probably fewer.

The newest version (V3) uses React, Laravel and Socket.io.

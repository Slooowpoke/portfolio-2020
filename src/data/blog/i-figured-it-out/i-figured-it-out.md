I finally worked out what was wrong with my implementation of a self organising map, instead of using a 1 dimensional list for the nodes in the lattice I changed it to a 2D dimensional array. 
This yielded the exact results I was looking for after changing this.

As you can see in the above, similar images are grouped together.

I'll explain the process in the future, I'll probably have to write it out for the dissertation anyway.

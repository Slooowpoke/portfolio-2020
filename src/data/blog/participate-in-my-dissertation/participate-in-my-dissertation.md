Ok, so I've started working towards my final year project at university. Feels like the whole thing has just whizzed past.

I have an idea in my head of what I'd like to do, but I need a hand from other people. That's where you guys come in!

If you could just head over to this ~~page~~* (Dissertation is over), and categorise the drawing by labeling what it is in the comments. If you see an eyeball, just write in the comments "eyeball". There's no requirement to label every drawing, just the obvious ones really. Text can be labelled if you just write out what it says.

The project should be able to categorise some of these drawings on there own. You guys are helping me form training data. If you could just do one or two drawings that would greatly help.

I'll post more about what's going on with it soon! Shhh hush hush, you'll see.

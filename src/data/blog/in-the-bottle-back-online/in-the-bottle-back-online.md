In The Bottle is now back online and better than ever. Faster loading speeds and not being suspended.

I've also added a few updates to it:

17/11/12 - Update 1.1
* Moved host
* Added user list
* Fixed drawing permissions issue
* Added more colours
* Added a top ten and bottom ten.

The site has been added to my portfolio and I'll continue to maintain it every now and then. I plan to work on Darkness Exhumed for a little bit and then return with a new addition to the InTheBottle family.

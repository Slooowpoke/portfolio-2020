I let this slide again, my bad. But I've finally managed to complete two personal projects. 

Most recently I've been working on [InTheBottle](https://inthebottle.co.uk) and this new website.

InTheBottle was an old PHP project which I put together in 2013. The website allows strangers to leave drawings and messages and grew to a fairly reasonable size.

But over time the website fell apart and was painfully difficult to maintain. When I came to fixing it after it had broken, it was just really bad programming at its core.

Since then I have learnt a ton of useful knowledge outside and in work. Looking back it was quite refreshing to see I had grown.

I've rebuilt the website with Laravel, React and Socket.io. Now it is complete I do question why Laravel is in there but it's what I've been using at work and is super quick to build API's with.

I probably should take the website and change it fully into a React application, instead of relying on Laravel for the routing. But at the time I only had planned for the drawing application to be built with React.

There are a ton of elements on the page, which are separate React apps, I'm not sure if this impacts performance but I have a feeling it might.

The new website includes better validation of the drawings, faster drawing loading and a realtime canvas at the top.

The site has been live a while and has had some masterpieces drawn on it, as well as the usual shit.

and obviously anything you see on the website I haven't pre-approved or checked. There is a ton of offensive content on the website.

However I have plans on how to combat this in the future.

As for my new website which you're look'n at right now!

[I built it with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which has been great. GraphQL was a bit fiddly to learn at the start but I think I have a handle on it now.

Gatsby is a static site generator meaning the page is making no external database calls when browsing. It's super super fast and you should definitely give it a go.

As for the style of this new site, I was kinda aiming for something a bit ["brutalist"?](http://brutalistwebsites.com/)

I think I might couple the site with something clean, white and professional in the future (or maybe a toggle switch?) but sometimes its fun to throw some purple and yellow around.

I love the straightforwardness of the site and how friggen quick it is. I do wonder if a HTML page can rival the speed Gatsby offers, since Gatsby does not reload all the content when navigating to different pages. 

I did use flex for both, and I think I might be regretting that now.

I want to make a game about moral choices. I want to make something that is kinda iffy.

Like the choice of saving terminally ill kids over saving an bus of 90+'s. Something really wrong like that.

Or maybe a game about catch-22's. Things that hurt to do but are the right things to do. I wonder if you can even convey that in a game or any medium.

I also want to make a game about distractions. Something that is constantly trying to grab your attention, I'm not sure.

Going to work a bit more on Jealous Rectangle, although I kinda want to give him eyes and call it jelly rectangle.

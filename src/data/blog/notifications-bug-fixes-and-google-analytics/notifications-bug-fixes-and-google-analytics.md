So I've been working a little bit on InTheBottle to have something to do and also to prepare it for a bigger update. 

This newest update is a strange one, but should be good (can't spill the details yet because its too early). 

The most recent addition to InTheBottle is Notifications. This means that when you comment/favourite someones drawing or message it gives them a notification letting them know that you care. I've already communicated with one of my users through it and it feels good. :3

I fixed two bugs which were pretty annoying, spamming form submission which should be stopped ish for now. I also fixed the ordering of comments so the latest is at the top and the oldest at the bottom (how it should be xD). I've also finally setup Google AnalyticsÂ on the site to get a better idea of what is going on with my users. So far its all positive with an average visit time of 10minutes and its good to see that there are more returning users than I thought. I think there might be a community forming on the site. Might add a shoutbox soon.. ;3

Thats all for now though, going to reward myself with some Kerbal Space Program and salad or something. Maybe just toast.

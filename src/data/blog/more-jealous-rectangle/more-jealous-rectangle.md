Jelly sounds weird I don't want that. I think I've worked out more about what the game will be about, which was surprisingly hard since I'm not thinking too straight. I may have an alcohol problem. Â Going to see 1984 tonight, then staying in Kingston till Tuesday. Going to cleanup and stuff. After that I think I want to get away from everything for a while. Go visit my Nan in Cornwall for potentially the rest of the summer. Spend my time on the beaches and running or something stupid like that.

The Jealous Rectangle in a way is me. Sort of. I wrote somewhere on here that I get jealous stupidly easy. Its more apparent now.

There I go again, expressing into a piece of the internet. Gotta stop doing that.

Nailed a description for the game.

"A 'Thomas was alone' inspired game about a rectangle and jealousy. Race to your lover on the other side of many obstacles and try not to be caught by the green ey'd monster chasing you"

Each level will have a series of goals which you can collect, collecting all of them results in gold, collecting some will result in silver etc along with a time, of course you can't take all the time in the world because of the green cloud chasing you.

The green cloud represents jealousy. Along with the main antagonist. There will be a story to it, I'm just deciding how I can make people relate to it as much as possible.

I added the "lover", all characters are gender neutral rectangles I made the lover jump which I found adorable.

I mean jee look at this thing.

Thats all I've got for now. Going to play with level transitions and maybe start the map editor.

Game development is so blissfully distracting.

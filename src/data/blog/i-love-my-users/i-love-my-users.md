I love my users. 

Some of the drawings that appear on InTheBottle.co.uk are amazing.

I love commenting on their drawings and saying "I love these" and seeing them reply "This has made my day!". Its great because I've made them happy about what they've done and the system I've programmed from scratch works great. I'm proud of that. That I wanted to communicate with them, so I built notifications.

Gah they do some really amazing stuff though. The most recent being a person called [parasox](https://inthebottle.co.uk/user/parasox). Seriously, go and check that stuff out. Its great.

Another awesome one, [spaceponies](https://inthebottle.co.uk/user/spaceponies).

[LoL](https://inthebottle.co.uk/user/LoL) seemed to develop their drawings as they went. You can even see the transition.

There's so many more that I love and aren't thinking of off the top of my head. But I love them all. I love that they've taken time out of their life and put it into something beautiful to share and that I've enabled them in a way.

Then there's all the anonymous people. They are great too! So many great anonymous drawings.



A small community that I've built and invested time into, makes me feel less lonely. Even if its only a couple people at a time.

Proving to be a healthy distraction. Keep feeling that I've made the right choice logically, but it feels like the wrong choice. Brain vs Heart I guess.

Heres a video of a cute little guy jumping.

I want to give him a name, but only a name that will be on this blog and nowhere else.

The game might have sound effects soon too! Rapidly falling together. Planning on finishing the green smog and then its just level design really. Level design and a lot of polish.

Again I want to sell it but I feel bad about it. Oh welp. Once I have a couple of levels I'll post a copy and then I can get feedback as I go.

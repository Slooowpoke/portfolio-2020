I was just sitting around and I had a great idea. Why not turn upvoting into a game? Vote to stay at the top of every page per week.

The most upvoted drawing is displayed at the top of the page and links to the user and the drawing.

The site stores upvotes over the course of 7 days. After 7 days it clears the table of that weeks upvotes.

I also re-added the user list under "browse users" theres around 460 users so plenty to explore.

That's all for now. Hopefully that gives a small burst of life.
